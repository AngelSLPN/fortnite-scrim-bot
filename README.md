# Fortnite Scrim bot for discord
scrim/snipe bot for discord built with node.js and discord.js

# Work in Progress
I still have few things left to do + maybe some extra commands if someone would want to. It's fully working right now, it just doesn't save server settings. Because of that, each time you restart you'll need to set up for new unless you just hard code it in files. You can do that in exports.js file.
